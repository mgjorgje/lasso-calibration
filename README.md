# lasso-calibration
This is a project for the course Nonparametrics that I took during the first semester in the Advanced Mathematics M2 program at ENS de Lyon.
The project was done in collaboration with Leo Davy.

It is about tuning the lasso parameter via Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Cross Validation (CV).
We studied the effects of dimensionality of the data, sparsity level and noise level affects the choice of each criterion.
